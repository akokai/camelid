Installation
============

Software dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``commongroups`` requires Python 3.5 and a number of Python packages, notably
`RDKit`_. It also requires an installation of PostgreSQL with the RDKit
database extension.

The recommended way to install most dependencies is with the `Anaconda`_
Python distribution, or the light-weight `Miniconda`_ distribution. Most
required packages can be installed with the `conda`_ package manager, and the
remainder can be installed using ``pip``. See ``requirements.txt`` for a list
of required python packages. 

Step-by-step installation instructions will be added in the future.
Installation instructions for `rdkit and PostgreSQL`_ are also helpful.
