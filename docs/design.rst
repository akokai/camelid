Design

General concepts
----------------

This is what we are trying to accomplish.

Chemical/material groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What are they...


Populating classes by structure-based searching
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Class definitions...


Screening compounds for class membership
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When we add new compounds... (We don't do this yet.)


Methods
-------

This is how we are trying to do it.

Structure-based searches in PubChem
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the most straightforward method to use initially because it doesn't require setting up any chemical informatics infrastructure. We simply submit queries to PubChem and the results come back.

What are PubChem Compounds...


Keeping up-to-date with new compounds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Compounds are constantly being added to PubChem. This means we may need to update the sets of compounds that are created by PubChem searches. So we keep track of when each class was last updated...
